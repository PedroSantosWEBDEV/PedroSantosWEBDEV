# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Repositorio que será utilizado para gerar os arquivos.

          # one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.
          #
          #  supported options:
          #  - palette:     A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
          #  - color_snake: Color of the snake
          #  - color_dots:  Coma separated list of dots color.
          #                 The first one is 0 contribution, then it goes from the low contribution to the highest.
          #                 Exactly 5 colors are expected.
